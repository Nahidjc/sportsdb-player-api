                            Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior (Brazilian Portuguese: ; born 5 February 1992), known as
                            Neymar,
                            is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as a forward for Ligue 1 club Paris
                            Saint-Germain and the Brazil national team. He is widely regarded as one of the best players
                            in
                            the world.

                            Neymar came into prominence at Santos, where he made his professional debut aged 17. He
                            helped
                            the club win two successive Campeonato Paulista championships, a Copa do Brasil, and the
                            2011
                            Copa Libertadores; the latter being Santos' first since 1963. Neymar was twice named the
                            South
                            American Footballer of the Year, in 2011 and 2012, and soon relocated to Europe to join
                            Barcelona. As part of Barcelona's attacking trio with Lionel Messi and Luis Suárez, he won
                            the
                            continental treble of La Liga, the Copa del Rey, and the UEFA Champions League, and finished
                            third for the FIFA Ballon d'Or in 2015 for his performances. He then attained a domestic
                            double
                            in the 2015–16 season. In 2017, Neymar transferred to Paris Saint-Germain in a move worth
                            €222
                            million, making him the most expensive player ever. In France, Neymar won three league
                            titles,
                            two Coupe de France, and two Coupe de la Ligue, which included a domestic treble and being
                            voted
                            Ligue 1 Player of the Year in his debut season. Neymar helped PSG attain a domestic
                            quadruple in
                            the 2019–20 season, and led the club to its first ever Champions League Final.

                            With 64 goals in 103 matches for Brazil since debuting at age 18, Neymar is the second
                            highest
                            goalscorer for his national team, trailing only Pelé. He was a key player in Brazil's
                            victories
                            at the 2011 South American Youth Championship, where he finished as leading goalscorer, and
                            the
                            2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, where he won the Golden Ball as player of the tournament. His
                            participation in the 2014 FIFA World Cup and 2015 Copa América was cut short by injury and a
                            suspension, respectively, before captaining Brazil to their first Olympic gold medal in
                            men's
                            football at the 2016 Summer Olympics. Two years later, having renounced the captaincy, he
                            featured at the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

                            Off the pitch, Neymar ranks among the world's most prominent sportsmen; SportsPro named him
                            the
                            most marketable athlete in the world in 2012 and 2013, and ESPN cited him as the world's
                            fourth-most famous athlete in 2016. In 2017, Neymar was included by Time in its list of the
                            100
                            most influential people in the world. By 2018, France Football ranked Neymar the world's
                            third
                            highest-paid footballer. In 2019, Forbes ranked him the world's third highest-paid athlete,
                            and
                            fourth highest-paid in 2020.
